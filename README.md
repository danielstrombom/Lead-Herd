To re-generate Figures 1A and 1B from 1. the simulation data used in the manuscript run the function makeFig1AB.m or 2. from new simulations run the function Fig1AB.m.


To re-generate Figure 1C from 1. the simulation data used in the manuscript run the function makeFig1C.m or 2. from new simulations run the function Fig1C.m.


To re-generate Figure 1D from 1. the simulation data used in the manuscript run the function makeFig1D.m or 2. from new simulations run the function Fig1D.m.


Note that re-generating the figures from simulations may take a very long time depending on your system, in particular, Figure 1D. We used MATLAB R2020b for these analyses.
